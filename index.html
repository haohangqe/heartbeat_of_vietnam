        <h2>Vietnam’s Motorbike Culture</h2>
        <p>
          "The easiest way I use to explain Vietnam’s traffic rules to foreigners is:
          “Vietnamese people move like fish.” Fish don’t stop when they meet each other
          — they just swerve aside. Vietnamese people are the same; they won’t stop just
          because they see you crossing the street, but they’ll find a way to keep moving 
          forward without hitting you, like two fish gliding past each other. What you need 
          to do is show them where you’re planning to 'swim.' Don’t hesitate or jerk around 
          in the middle of the road — you’ll just confuse the other fish."</p>

        <p>
          Motorbikes have long been the lifeblood of Vietnam’s streets, weaving
          through alleys, bridges, and boulevards with unmatched rhythm. 
          Motorbikes are deeply tied to everyday life in Vietnam, serving as the
          main form of transportation for most families. They
          represent more than just transportation — they are part of the nation’s
          identity and evolution. Today’s modern cities, the motorbike has 
          witnessed Vietnam’s growth, carrying generations of stories and dreams.

        <h2>Memories & Experiences</h2>
        <p>
          For me, the motorbike represents childhood memories sitting behind 
          my parents with my small arms wrapped around them on early morning 
          rides. Riding gives me a sense of freedom and connection to the 
          city — like the wind, the noise, the
          rhythm of the streets.
        </p>
        <p>
          I still remember fun motorbike experiences with my loved ones, or
          small accidents that taught me awareness and respect
          for safety on the road. Yeah, you can say it’s riskier than other 
          ways of getting around, but I still love it for its convenience and cultural vibe. 
          Others might appreciate motorbikes as much as I do because they
          symbolize independence, mobility, and the spirit of daily Vietnamese
          life. A motorbike isn’t just transportation; it’s a companion through
          different stages of growing up and exploring the world.

        <h2>Reflections</h2>
        <p>
          Even now, every time I get on a motorbike, I feel that same sense of
          freedom and nostalgia. It reminds me of home, of simple moments, and of
          how something so ordinary can carry so many emotions and memories. The
          sound of the engine, the smell of the road, and the cool breeze brushing
          past — all these bring me back to the essence of Vietnamese life.
